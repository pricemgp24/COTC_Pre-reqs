## Install WireGuard

# WireGuard is not available in the default repositories on Rocky Linux 9. Follow the steps below to enable the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository and install WireGuard on your server.
# Install the EPEL repository.
sudo dnf install epel-release -y

# Install the WireGuard tools package.
sudo dnf install wireguard-tools -y

#View the installed WireGuard version on your server.
sudo wg --version

# Your output should be similar to the one below.
# wireguard-tools v1.0.20210914 - https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/

## Configure WireGuard

# WireGuard uses the cryptokey routing mechanism to create VPN tunnels on your server by checking public keys linked to specific IP addresses. 
# WireGuard requires a private key that matches a valid public key to enable VPN tunnel connections on a network interface. Follow these steps to set up a new WireGuard interface and create key pairs to use on your server.
# Generate a new WireGuard server private and public key pair in the /etc/wireguard directory.
wg genkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/server_private.key | wg pubkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/server_public.key

# Modify the file permissions to grant only privileged users read access to the generated keys.
sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/server_private.key /etc/wireguard/server_public.key

# View your available server network interfaces and verify your main interface details.
ip a

# Your output should be similar to the one below.

# Based on the above output. enp1s0 is the main public network interface name and uses the public IP address 192.0.2.161 required by WireGuard to translate and forward network requests to the Internet.
# Create a new WireGuard server interface configuration file. For example, wg0.conf.
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

# Add the following configurations to the file. Replace <Server_Private_Key> with the actual private key you generated earlier.

[Interface]
Address = 172.16.0.1/24
SaveConfig = true
PrivateKey = <Server_Private_Key>
ListenPort = 51820

# Save and close the file.
# The above WireGuard configuration creates a new interface with the private IP address 172.16.0.1. Within the configuration:
# Address = 172.16.0.1/24: Assigns the private IP address 172.16.0.1 to the WireGuard interface, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
# SaveConfig = true: Enables WireGuard to automatically save the configuration when the server shuts down.
# PrivateKey = <Server_Private_Key>: Sets the WireGuard server's private key.
# ListenPort = 51820: Sets the WireGuard server port 51820 to listen for incoming VPN connection requests.

### Generate WireGuard Client Configurations

# A WireGuard client configuration consists of a private and public key pair allowed to create connections through the WireGuard server tunnel interface. 
# In the following steps, create a new WireGuard client configuration that includes new private and public keys, permitted addresses, and traffic to allow on the VPN tunnel connections.
# Generate new private and public keys in the WireGuard directory /etc/wireguard/. Replace client with your desired client naming scheme.
wg genkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/client_private.key | wg pubkey | sudo tee /etc/wireguard/client_public.key

#View the generated WireGuard client private and public key values.
sudo cat /etc/wireguard/client_private.key /etc/wireguard/client_public.key

#Copy the generated private and public key values to your clipboard.
#Create a new WireGuard client configuration file.
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/client.conf

#Add the following configurations to the file. Replace <Client_Private_Key> with your generated private key, <Server_Public_Key>, 
#192.0.2.161 with your actual WireGuard server's public key and IP address respectively.
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Client_Private_Key>
Address = 172.16.0.2/24
DNS = 8.8.8.8

[Peer]
PublicKey = <Server_Public_Key>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 192.0.2.161:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 15

#Save and close the file.
#The above configuration assigns creates a new WireGuard client with the private VPN tunnel IP address 172.16.0.2. Within the configuration:
#PrivateKey: Sets the WireGuard client's private key used for encryption and authentication in the VPN tunnel.
#Address: Sets the WireGuard client's private IP address 172.16.0.2 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
#DNS: Sets Google public DNS server 8.8.8.8 as the DNS resolver to resolve domain names when connected to the VPN tunnel.
#PublicKey: Sets the public key of the destination WireGuard server.
#AllowedIPs: Defines the network client network addresses allowed to connect through the VPN tunnel.
#Endpoint: Sets the WireGuard server public IP address 192.0.2.161 and port 51820 to use when connecting to the VPN tunnel.
#PersistentKeepalive: Keeps the VPN connection active by sending keep-alive packets every 15 seconds.

#Open the WireGuard server interface configuration to enable the new client configuration.
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

#Add the following configurations at the end of the file. Replace <Client_Public_Key> with your actual WireGuard client's public key you generated earlier.
[Peer]
PublicKey = <Client_Public_Key>
AllowedIPs = 172.16.0.2/32

# Save and close the file.

### Manage WireGuard VPN Processes

# The WireGuard wg-quick utility starts and manages VPN processes on your server. Follow the steps below to enable your WireGuard interface to start at boot time and allow VPN tunnels on your server using the wg-quick utility.
# Start the WireGuard server wg0 interface.
sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service

# Enable the WireGuard wg0 interface to automatically start at boot time.
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service

# View the WireGuard interface status and verify that it's active on your server.
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service

#Output.

# Set Up Firewall Rules

# FirewallD is available and active on Vultr Rocky Linux 9 servers by default. In the following steps, configure the firewall to allow network connections on the default WireGuard server port 51820. In addition, enable port forwarding to forward network requests from the WireGuard interface to the internet using Network Address Translation (NAT) on your server.
# View the firewalld status and verify that it's active.
sudo systemctl status firewalld

# If the firewalldstatus is inactive, run the following command to allow the SSH port 22 and enable the firewall.
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=22/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Allow the default WireGuard interface UDP port 51820 through the firewall.
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=51820/udp

# Reload firewalldto apply your configuration changes.
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# View all available firewalldport rules on your server and verify that the WireGuard port is available.
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports

#Output.
51820/udp
22/tcp

# Enable IPV4 forwarding to forward packets from the WireGuard network to the server's public interface.
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

# Reload your sysctl configuration to apply the configuration changes.
sudo sysctl -p

# Enable address translation of network requests from the WireGuard interface 172.16.0.0/24 subnet to allow client connections to the Internet.
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="172.16.0.0/24" masquerade'

# Reload firewalldto apply the new configuration changes.
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Connect VPN Clients to the WireGuard VPN Server

# Each WireGuard client requires a valid configuration file with a public key allowed to connect to the WireGuard VPN server interface. In the following steps, connect VPN clients to your WireGuard VPN server using the configuration you created earlier and test the VPN tunnel connections using the Ping utility.
# Access your Rocky Linux 9 client server using SSH.
ssh exampleuser@SERVER-IP

# Install the EPEL repository and the WireGuard tools package on your server.
sudo dnf install epel-release -y && sudo dnf install wireguard-tools -y

# Download your WireGuard client configuration file from the VPN server using a file transfer protocol such as scp.
sudo scp root@wireguard-server-ip:/etc/wireguard/client.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

# Enable the systemd-resolved service to enable DNS resolutions on the WireGuard network.
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved && sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

# Enable the WireGuard client interface wg0 to connect to the VPN tunnel.
